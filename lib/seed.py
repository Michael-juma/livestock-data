fmd = Disease(

    description="""Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and wild animals like deer and antelope. It is caused by an aphthovirus of the family Picornaviridae and is characterized by fever and blister-like sores on the mouth, tongue, lips, and between the hooves.

FMD spreads rapidly through direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed, water, equipment, and even through the air over short distances. Infected animals may exhibit lameness, drooling, reluctance to move, and loss of appetite. Though the mortality rate is low in adult animals, the disease can be fatal in young animals and causes severe production losses due to decreased milk yield, weight loss, and trade restrictions.

FMD does not typically infect humans but can cause serious economic impact due to outbreaks. Control measures include quarantines, movement restrictions, culling infected animals, and routine vaccination programs in endemic areas. Early detection and strict biosecurity are critical for containment.

anthrax = Disease(
    name="Anthrax",

    region="Worldwide",
    description="""Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Bacillus anthracis*. It primarily affects livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goats, but can also infect humans who come into contact with infected animals or animal products. The bacterium forms durable spores that can survive in soil for decades and enter an animalâ€™s body through ingestion, inhalation, or open wounds.

In animals, anthrax can cause sudden death with minimal signs. Symptoms may include high fever, difficulty breathing, convulsions, and swelling. In some cases, blood may ooze from the mouth, nose, or anus. In humans, anthrax manifests in cutaneous, inhalational, or gastrointestinal forms, each with varying symptoms and severity.

Anthrax is a zoonotic disease and is considered a potential biological weapon due to the resilience of its spores. Preventive measures include regular livestock vaccination in endemic areas and proper disposal of carcasses. Humans can be protected through occupational safety practices and, in certain cases, vaccines.

It can manifest in acute, subacute, or chronic forms, leading to a range of symptoms including fever, skin lesions, and arthritis. The disease is often associated with poor management practices and can result in significant economic losses in swine production.

In acute cases, affected pigs may exhibit sudden fever, lethargy, and skin lesions that can progress to diamond-shaped patches. Chronic infections can lead to arthritis and endocarditis, making early detection and treatment crucial.

Preventive measures include good hygiene practices, proper nutrition, and vaccination in high-risk herds. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, but prevention is the most effective strategy.
